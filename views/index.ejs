      Thanks for checking out my personal site!

      If you're curious about what I used to build it, its repo is here:
      The trickiest bit was using React and ReactDOMServer to get React views to render client and server-side.
      I also had to listen to 'animationend' events to get the right animations for the page transitions.
      It's definitely over-engineered for its purpose, but I enjoyed writing it :) Feel free to contact me about it!
